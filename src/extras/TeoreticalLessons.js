// 160 - React Hooks and their Rules

/* 
    1. React Hooks are special built-in functions that allow 
    you to use state and other React features in functional
    components. They allow us to "hook into".
    React internals:
        - Creating and accessing state from Fiber tree;
        - Registring side effects in the Fiber tree;
        - Manual DOM selections;
        - etc.
    2. React Hooks are functions that always start with "use" keyword.
